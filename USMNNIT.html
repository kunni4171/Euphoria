                    "My college life would be one of the best chapters in my life. Had a wonderful time meeting people from the
                    time of registration, hostel, Swagat, DASA group, Avishkar,Culrav,
                    VCAS and learning a lot from these folks. I am so glad that I met really helpful seniors
                    and have bonded with my juniors who are true gems. I still canâ€™t digest this abrupt ending.

                    We will surely miss subah-subah roommate ka nonstop alarm, cleaning aunty ki baatein, mess
                    aunty seh spoon lena, dadu ki shop seh anytime icecreams, Amul ki coffee, mungfali wali aunty ki
                    free mungfali with chutney, cycle theek karne wale bhaiya, maggie point with juniors, crossing,
                    boring classes mei masti, even bunking classes for random reasons, bika pe birthday celebrations,
                    jungle canteen after classes, sitting at ground, just walking around campus with the best one,
                    giving telephonic interview near Vijaya bank, walking back through the end of the world(tunnel),
                    reaching hostel gate just on time, late-night briefing sessions, signing night register and
                    complaining, and of course nonstop talks about everything in those rooms. And, so much more.

                    We  will really miss MNNIT and the people <br>
                     So, better cherish every moment of your life especially college life."<br>

                    Getting up and running to classes in 5 min, then sleeping in every class, then roaming in campus till the last minute of intime,
                    then sitting in common room god knows what we did  till 3am 
                      finally binge-watching some web series and then sleeping till 9am.
                    Basic routine of an engineering student.

                    The best part about college life was, it gave soo much free time to explore the other dimensions of life!!!
                    From skipping classes to skipping End Sem Exams!!! (still managed to pass)
                    You will grow a lot in these four years!!!
                    The most important thing I have
                    learned here was to accept people as they are and not expect them to act in a way you assume they
                    should.
