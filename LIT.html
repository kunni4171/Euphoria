        Luxury Of Literature

        While thought exists, words are alive and literature becomes an escape, not from, but into living.

            Online College Life
            From having an unexpected start to an end of first semester ....wait is still on..
        </h1>
        <p>
            So my first sem ended the beginning still left that good start of my college life the pandemic really theft In the days of preparation. my heart used to console "college life is so gratifying" when felt of not studying more

I started that phase four months ago,

how the time passed.I really don't know those dreamy eyes compelled to sit in front of laptop the wishes on a letter washed away drop by drop..

I thought of roaming in the campus. Ahh! my fate I wonder, when would I be able to see the college gate "the time of first year is most amusing", heard somewhere why my clock isn't showing that time. I do fear too many genius minds, in this new family, still I don't know how to talk freely.. surrounded by people, possessing so much talent but there are many faces, I haven't seen yet...

ofcourse collected some incidents in the basket of memory chanting between the class or joining it in a hurry learnt spamming or even that plus one, astonishing to the asked doubts,omg! I have none...

never bothered for the notes, CRs were there, they provided everything and deserve a huge cheer. so excited to meet everyone, the day will surely come it's going to be the perfect remedy for my lonesome.</span>

        Dear Bunny and Aditi,
     </h1>
     <p>

Friendships are fragile. Aren't they? Things change and friends leave. But you would always find that same friend yelling at the top of his lungs, shouting, "I am still here you idiot, right behind your back. You gotta do this and leap of faith. Don't be a coward."

And probably this is that one friend you laugh with. You play with them, you shout at them or you might even share a love-hate relationship with them. You annoy them with your silliest pranks, but they will listen to all your rants at any odd hour of the day, they make you see the sun at the place where you once saw the cloud, and they will always be your ray of hope and light in this compact fragile shell called 'life'. And that's how it's supposed to be, messed up at times though strong enough to withstand any hurdle that comes our way. So, were both of you, Bunny and Aditi.<br>
