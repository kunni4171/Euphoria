                    I can't believe they made this in 1998! And, if released today, could give anything out there a run
                    for it's money.
                    The movie was an emotional rollercoaster.
                    Best movie to ever capture the extent which soldiers had to go through in battle.
                    The starting scene of landing at Normandy itself shows that war is not glorious, the second half was
                    much more gripping and the climax was the jewel of the the crown.<br>

                <h1>The Shawshank Redemption</h1>
                <p>
                    I watched "The Shawshank Redemption" and was moved. Wanted to watch few more movies of his type and
                    tried "Forrest Gump". Now, these two are one of the few greatest movies in my list. When I started
                    watching this movie. I thought it will be a motivatinal movie and not much entertaining. But, in few
                    minutes, the outlook changes to a romance genre. And then, in no time, it will be a comedy movie. It
                    changes to action, war, a bit of sports and what not. Then, it was just oscillating between all
                    genres and finally creates it own outstanding genre<br>

                    Haikyu
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Haikyuu means Volleyball in Japanese
                    and thaes what the series is about. The
                    best thing about Haikyuu is the individual
                    character development of all the characters
                    and the occasional funny jabs make it even
                    ore fun. So intense, so amazing. One of my favorites!
                    Haruichi Furudate wrote the series
                    as a gritty tale of passion and
                    love for the sport and a dialogue

                    from an episode goes like, "Dont
                    you dare look down. Hold your
                    heads high, because Volleyball
                    is a sport where we are always
                    looking up."
